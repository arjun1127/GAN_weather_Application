# GAN-Based Weather Simulation System

This project utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to simulate realistic weather conditions on any given input image. By leveraging adversarial training, the system can apply transformations such as fog, rain, snow, and sunny weather to input images while retaining their structural and visual integrity.

## Overview

The **GAN-Based Weather Simulation System** is designed for image-to-image translation to create realistic weather simulations. The project uses a generator-discriminator framework to generate images that depict specific weather conditions. Currently, the system produces random weather transformations. Future enhancements aim to condition the model for specific user-desired weather outputs.

---

## Features

- Generates weather-transformed images with realistic effects.
- Adversarial training ensures high-quality outputs.
- Supports various weather effects such as fog, rain, and snow.
- Modular architecture for easy extension and experimentation.

---

## Prerequisites

### Hardware
- NVIDIA GPU (Recommended for training)
- Minimum 8 GB RAM

### Software
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.11.0+
- torchvision 0.12.0+
- Matplotlib for visualization
- NumPy for numerical operations

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arjun1127/GAN_weather_Application.git
   cd GAN_weather_Application
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset Preparation

The project uses the **Cityscapes dataset** for training. Follow these steps to prepare the dataset:

1. Download the Cityscapes dataset from [here](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/).
2. Resize and preprocess the images to the desired input format (e.g., 128x128 or 256x256).
3. Organize the dataset:
   ```
   dataset/
   ├── train/
   │   ├── img1.png
   │   ├── img2.png
   │   └── ...
   ├── val/
   │   ├── img1.png
   │   ├── img2.png
   │   └── ...
   └── test/
   ```
4. Update the dataset path in the training script.

## Model Architecture

### Generator
- Composed of transposed convolutional layers and activation functions.
- Learns to apply weather transformations while preserving the input image's structural details.

### Discriminator
- Built using convolutional layers.
- Distinguishes between real weather-transformed images and those generated by the generator.

---

## Training Procedure

1. **Training Setup**:
   - Adjust hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and training epochs in the configuration file.
   - Define the generator and discriminator models using PyTorch.

2. **Adversarial Training**:
   - The generator creates weather-transformed images from random latent vectors.
   - The discriminator evaluates the generated images against real weather-transformed images.
   - Both networks are updated iteratively to improve their performance.

3. **Checkpointing**:
   - Model weights are saved periodically during training for later evaluation or inference.

---

## Usage

### Inference
To generate weather-transformed images:
1. Place input images in the `input/` directory.
2. Run the inference script:
   ```bash
   python generate.py --input input/ --output output/
   ```
3. The results will be saved in the `output/` directory.

---

## Results

The model generates high-quality weather transformations. Below are examples of the input-output pairs:

| Input Image | Weather-Transformed Image |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| ![Input](example_images/input.jpg) | ![Output](![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd20383d-65f1-4ced-b522-fbf23844d5d7)
 |

## Future Improvements

- **Conditional Weather Simulation**: Allow users to specify desired weather conditions.
- **High-Resolution Outputs**: Train the model to handle higher-resolution images.
- **Additional Weather Effects**: Incorporate more weather scenarios like thunderstorms or sandstorms.
